  The other day I was going through the
  %a{href: "https://github.com/settings/applications", target: :_black}
    OAuth tokens on my github account,
  and managed to completely break VS Code's new Sync
  functionality.  Every request returned a 401, but
  when I click to "Turn On..." sync, it would not prompt
  to re-authenticate.

  I spent a day debugging this, only to find a simple
  answer:  Delete the 
  %code vscode-github.login
  entry in your MacOS Keychain.
  %a{href: '/images/vscode-github-keychain.png', target: :_blank}
    %img.img-center{align: :middle,
                    style: 'max-width: 480px;',
                    src: '/images/vscode-github-keychain.png',
                    alt: 'Screenshot of MacOS Keychain application, showing the vscode-github.login entry'}
  
%p
  Once this is done, "Turn off" and "Turn On" sync again
  and it should prompt to re-authenticate.  Easy!
