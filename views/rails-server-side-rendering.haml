  A few months ago I stubmled across the world of developers who
  stream on Twitch.  Many of the steams I've watched are working
  in Vue, React, Angular, Svelte and other wonderful front end
  frameworks.  This got me thinking: Can I accomplish similar
  functionality using Rails, and preferably with a light-weight
  Javascript front end.

%p
  To that end, I began work, like many Twitch streamers do, on
  an overlay bot to overlay Twitch chat onto the stream itself.
  %img.max-width{src: '', title: 'Screenshot of chat overlay'}

%h2 Comfy.js
%p
  Comfy.js is a Javascript SDK for interacting with Twitch chat
  in the browser.

%h2 Action Cable

    Action Cable
  is a framework within Rails for communcating over WebSockets
  between a browser and a Rails server.  Action Cable is used
  to transfer inbound messages from Comfy.js to the Rails backend.
