  A few months ago I stubmled across the world of developers who
  stream on Twitch.  Many of the steams I've watched are working
  in Vue, React, Angular, Svelte and other wonderful front end
  frameworks.  This got me thinking: Can I accomplish similar
  functionality using Rails, and preferably with a light-weight
  Javascript front end.

%p
  To that end, I began work, like many Twitch streamers do, on
  an overlay bot to overlay Twitch chat onto the stream itself.
  My intent was to learn how to do server-rendered HTML,
  delivered like others have done in Javascript.  Rails all the
  way down, as it were.  Let's talk about the Rails tech which
  made this possible.

%h2 Action Cable
%p
  %a{href: 'https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html', target: :_blank}
    Action Cable
  is a framework within Rails for communcating over WebSockets
  between a browser and a Rails server.  In the overlay bot,
  Action Cable is used to transfer inbound messages from
  Twitch (via
  %a{href: 'https://github.com/instafluff/ComfyJS', target: :_blank}
    Comfy.js
  ) to the Rails backend.  Once there, the message is rendered
  into HTML, and sent back to the browser via ActionCable.

%p
  Action Cable makes this easy with both
  %a{href: 'https://github.com/exegete46/number-two/blob/main/app/javascript/channels/twitch_messages_channel.js', target: :_blank}
    client side
  and
  %a{href: 'https://github.com/exegete46/number-two/blob/main/app/channels/twitch_messages_channel.rb', target: :_blank}
    server side
  channels to talk on.   The channels allow messages of many
  types to be transported over the same websocket.

%h2 Active Job
%p
  %a{href: 'https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html', target: :_blank}
    Active Job
  is a way of spinning off a Job into the background, while Rails
  finishes serving a web request.  The most common example is
  sending an email.  A web request comes in, spins off a job, and
  returns a 302 redirect.  In the background, Active Job renders
  the HTML, CSS, etc, and then sends the email.

%p
  For my application, I'm using Active Job to render chat messages,
  and broadcast those messages over Action Cable.  Included in this
  is 
  %a{href: '', target: :_blank}
    fetching and caching the Twitch users' avatar URL.
