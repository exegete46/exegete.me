		100 days of Blog is something of a new years resolution for me.  I like
		writing, I like sharing my journey as a developer, but I have not written
		as many posts as I would like.
		%em #100DaysOfBlog
		is me trying to fix that.

		%b Heads up!
		I do not intend this as a starter for someone who is new to development.
		This topic has been tackled by much better writers than I, so I would
		suggest starting there if you are new to development.  I plan to start the
		articles focusing on Ruby, so if you're interested in learning Ruby, I
		began that part of my journey with
		%a{ href: 'https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby/programming-ruby-2nd-edition/',
				title: 'Programming Ruby by Dave Thomas with Chad Fowler and Andy Hunt' }
			Programming Ruby.
		As always, your mileage may vary.

	%h2 Personal Journey
	%p
		I am an entirely self-taught programmer, starting in a computer lab in high
		school when I was given an independent study, intending to write plugins for
		%a{ href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)',
				title: 'Quake (video game) article on Wikipedia' }
			Quake.
		I thought I could buy a Microsoft book on C++ and be productive by the end of
		the year.  Oh, to be young and naive again.  At the same time, I was exposed
		to Visual Basic while working at a local computer repair shop.
		After finishing high school I ran into the Perl programming language, and
		actually built useful scripts for automating my FreeBSD personal servers.

	%p
		My experience in Perl and Visual Basic landed me a job with a small company
		writing software for bottled-water home delivery.  The newly released Windows
		CE handheld computers, would change the industry!  Spoiler alert:  It didn't,
		and the company went under.

	%p
		From there, I picked up a part time job "finishing" a partially completed
		Perl application for selling insurance online.  I've been working on that
		software (or versions there-of) for the last 17 years.  In the mean time,
		I've strove to learn a new language every year, and usually a new web
		framework at the same time. Eventually, I've landed on Ruby on Rails as
		my goto web stack.

	%p
		I continue to learn, read, and evolve, but I have not yet found a compelling
		language and framework to pull me away from Rails, but I keep looking.
		That has lead me to watching live programming streams, and added a drive to
		give back to the community that helped me get where I am, and hopefully share
		some of the wonder I've found in programming.
